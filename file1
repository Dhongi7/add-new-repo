Ansible is a software tool that provides simple but powerful automation for crossplatform computer support.
 It is primarily intended for IT professionals, who use it for 
application deployment, updates on workstations and servers, cloud provisioning, 
configuration management, intra-service orchestration, and nearly anything a systems 
administrator does on a weekly or daily basis. Ansible doesn't depend on agent 
software and has no additional security infrastructure, so it's easy to deploy.
Because Ansible is all about automation, it requires instructions to accomplish each 
job. With everything written down in simple script form, it's easy to do version 
control. The practical result of this is a major contribution to the "infrastructure as 
code" movement in IT: the idea that the maintenance of server and client 
infrastructure can and should be treated the same as software development, with 
repositories of self-documenting, proven, and executable solutions capable of running 
an organization regardless of staff changes.
While Ansible may be at the forefront of automation, systems administration, and 
DevOps, it's also useful to everyday users. Ansible allows you to configure not just 
one computer, but potentially a whole network of computers at once, and using it 
requires no programming skills. Instructions written for Ansible are human-readable. 
Whether you're entirely new to computers or an expert, Ansible files are easy to 
understand.

How Ansible Works?
In Ansible, there are two categories of computers: the control node and managed 
nodes. The control node is a computer that runs Ansible. There must be at least one 
control node. A managed node is any device being managed by the control node.
Ansible works by connecting to nodes (clients, servers, or whatever you're 
configuring) on a network, and then sending a small program called an Ansible 
module to that node. Ansible executes these modules over SSH and removes them 
when finished. The only requirement for this interaction is that your Ansible control 
node has login access to the managed nodes. SSH keys are the most common way to 
provide access. 
Ansible management node is the controlling node, which controls the entire execution 
of the Playbook. It’s the node from which you are running the installation, and the 
inventory file provides the list of the host where the modules need to be run. The 
management node makes ssh connection, and then it executes the modules on the host 
machines and installs the product. It removes the modules once they are installed. So 
that’s how ansible works
Installing Ansible
Control node requirements :
Currently Ansible can be run from any machine with Python 2 (version 2.7) or Python 
3 (versions 3.5 and higher) installed. This includes Red Hat, Debian, CentOS, macOS, 
any of the BSDs, and so on. Windows is not supported for the control node.
Installing Ansible on RHEL, CentOS :
RPMs for currently supported versions of RHEL and CentOS are also available from 
EPEL repository. First you need to configure EPEL repository in RHEL or centOS 
using the below steps :
RHEL/CentOS 7:
#yum install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
RHEL/CentOS 8:
#yum install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.

Copying File from Ansible Engine to Ansible Clients :
$ansible db -m copy -a "src=./myhosts dest=/tmp"
Now give the Destination File Name Different:
$ansible db -m copy -a "src=./myhosts dest=/tmp/file1"
Re Run the Same above command to see the property of Ansible is Idempotent:
$ansible db -m copy -a "src=./myhosts dest=/tmp/file1"
Do Some Changes to my Hosts and Execute Again :
$ansible db -m copy -a "src=./myhosts dest=/tmp/file1"
Copying File other Way :
$ansible db -m copy -a "content='Good Morning, Learning Ansible is Fun' 
dest=/tmp/file2"
Modify the Content & Take Backup :
$ansible db -m copy -a "content='Learning Ansible is Easy' dest=/tmp/file2 
backup=yes"
Downloading File from Ansible Client to Ansible Engine :
$ansible db -m fetch -a "src=/home/ansadmin/hello.text dest=./demo"
$pwd
/home/ansadmin/demo
$ls -R
Now Copying the file with out Tree Structure :
$ansible db -m fetch -a "src=/home/ansadmin/hello.txt 
dest=./demo/{{inventory_hostname}}_hello.txt flat=yes"
$pwd
/home/ansadmin/demo
