Ansible is a software tool that provides simple but powerful automation for crossplatform computer support.
 It is primarily intended for IT professionals, who use it for 
application deployment, updates on workstations and servers, cloud provisioning, 
configuration management, intra-service orchestration, and nearly anything a systems 
administrator does on a weekly or daily basis. Ansible doesn't depend on agent 
software and has no additional security infrastructure, so it's easy to deploy.
Because Ansible is all about automation, it requires instructions to accomplish each 
job. With everything written down in simple script form, it's easy to do version 
control. The practical result of this is a major contribution to the "infrastructure as 
code" movement in IT: the idea that the maintenance of server and client 
infrastructure can and should be treated the same as software development, with 
repositories of self-documenting, proven, and executable solutions capable of running 
an organization regardless of staff changes.
While Ansible may be at the forefront of automation, systems administration, and 
DevOps, it's also useful to everyday users. Ansible allows you to configure not just 
one computer, but potentially a whole network of computers at once, and using it 
requires no programming skills. Instructions written for Ansible are human-readable. 
Whether you're entirely new to computers or an expert, Ansible files are easy to 
understand.
